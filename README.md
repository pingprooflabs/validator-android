# Validator Android App

The **Validator Android App** is part of the [Ping Proof Labs](https://pingproof.io) network ‚Äî a decentralized uptime monitoring system powered by mobile validators worldwide.

Android devices connect to the PingProof backend via MQTT, perform lightweight API uptime and latency checks, and report results in real time. Rewards are handled on Solana-compatible wallets.

## Features
- üîó Phantom & Solflare wallet integration
- üì° Real-time task dispatch with MQTT
- üìä API uptime/latency validation
- üåç Geo-distributed participation
- ‚ö° Background execution support

## Requirements
- Android Studio (Arctic Fox or newer)
- Java 17+
- Android SDK 24+

## Quick Start
1) **Clone**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pingprooflabs/validator-android.git
cd validator-android
```
3) **Open in Android Studio** and run on a device/emulator.

## üîß Configuration

All runtime configuration is kept in [`Environment.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/example/ping_proof/Environment.kt).

By default, the file contains **only empty strings or safe Devnet values**.  
This means you can build and run the app without worrying about leaking secrets.

If you want to run against a real backend or MQTT broker:

1. Open `app/src/main/java/com/example/ping_proof/Environment.kt`
2. Replace the empty strings with your actual values:
   - `baseUrl` ‚Üí your backend API URL
   - `MQTT_BROKER_URL` ‚Üí your MQTT broker address
   - `MQTT_USERNAME` ‚Üí broker username
   - `MQTT_PASSWORD` ‚Üí broker password
   - `SOLANA_CLUSTER` ‚Üí choose from `RpcCluster.Devnet`, `RpcCluster.Testnet`, or `RpcCluster.MainnetBeta`

3. Rebuild and run the app.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not commit your updated values** if they contain secrets. Always reset them before pushing changes.


### Environment switching
The app includes an `Environment.kt` enum with `DEV` and `PROD`. Values are sourced from `BuildConfig` so you can reuse the same APK with different configs.

See `app/src/main/java/com/example/ping_proof/Environment.kt` (provided below) for the final version.
